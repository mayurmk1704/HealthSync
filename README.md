## 🚀 Overview

HealthSync is a cutting-edge web application that enables healthcare providers to collaboratively train machine learning models to predict patient health risks (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) **without ever sharing or centralizing raw, sensitive patient data**. 

Instead of sending data to a central server, HealthSync sends the model to the data sources (hospitals/clinics), trains it locally, and only aggregates the learned model updates. This approach, known as **Federated Learning**, is at the forefront of privacy-centric AI and is crucial for industries bound by strict regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **Privacy by Design**: Patient data never leaves the hospital's infrastructure
- 🤖 **Federated Learning**: Collaborative model training without data centralization
- 📊 **Real-Time Dashboard**: Monitor training progress and model performance live
- 🏥 **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple healthcare providers
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security**: JWT authentication, RBAC, and HTTPS
- 📈 **Advanced Analytics**: Visualize aggregated, anonymized insights
- 🐳 **Production-Ready**: Full Docker containerization and CI/CD pipeline

## 🏗️ Architecture

HealthSync is built as a monorepo containing multiple interconnected services:
